# portfolio-page

Learning project: Admin Dashboard turned Portfolio Page

Built with:

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla JavaScript

Tools:

- VisualStudio Code
- Linux CLI
- Git & GitHub
- Emmet

What I've learned:

- Experience working with, and animating SVG's.
- Grid experience.
- More FlexBox.
- Creating iFrames.

My thoughts on the project:

I've gone off the beaten path again... and have turned this project into a Potfolio Page.
I hope to re-visit this project to continually improve it as a showcase of my work and experience.
I've also come to the conclusion that I prefer using FlexBox over Grid. Flexbox has more use cases it seems, and true to its name is far more flexible. I think I'll only use Grid when I require a literal grid.

Things I'd like to add:

- Dark/Light theme.
- Zoomed out iframes.
- More structured, aesthetic, and intricate layout.
